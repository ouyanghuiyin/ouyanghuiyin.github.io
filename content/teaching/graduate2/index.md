This course introduces the concepts of operations management and the application of analytic techniques in solving problems an organization faces in its operations.
An organization's ultimate success depends on how efficiently and effectively it executes its strategic goals. This requires its operational goals to be aligned with its strategic goals. A detailed understanding of the processes used to produce and deliver goods and/or provide services to customers is essential. Operations Management is a field which focuses on these aspects of an organization.
Operations of an organization concerns the management of the processes which convert inputs into outputs. Effective operations management involves managing people, equipment, and other resources. In the typical business organization the majority of the costs and controllable assets are managed by the operations function. Thus, this discipline–with the techniques, procedures and knowledge it encompasses–is a vital segment of business activity.
This course will provide students with the analytical tools needed to understand and articulate the impact of an organization's processes and the ability to continuously improve these processes.
