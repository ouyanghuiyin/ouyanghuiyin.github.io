This course introduces simulation modeling to analyze business processes and solve practical problems. Students will gain basic knowledge such as Monte Carlo simulation and discrete event simulation and learn to build simulation models of business processes and interpret simulation results, and more importantly, facilitate decision-making process. This is a hands-on course on computer simulation with @Risk (www.palisade.com) and Simio (www.simio.com).
