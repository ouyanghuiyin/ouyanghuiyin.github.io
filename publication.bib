	abstract = {For many service systems, waiting time is a critical performance indicator of customer experience. This study addresses service-level computation techniques in a time-varying mixed-preemptive priorities queueing system. This queueing system has two distinguishing characteristics. First, it has time-varying arrival rates and service capacities. Second, and more importantly, there are multiple classes of customers, and both preemptive and non-preemptive priorities are considered in this system. Combining these two characteristics in a queueing system makes it difficult to compute the service level for each customer class. We derive the exact computation methods for pointwise and piecewise service levels. Furthermore, we propose closed-form expressions to approximate the service levels. Lastly, we show how to apply these service-level computation techniques to a real-life physician staffing problem in the emergency department, in which the service levels of each class of patients are considered as constraints. The computational tests are performed using data generated based on real data from a large hospital. The results show that our staffing solutions are better than the hospital’s current staffing solution, guaranteeing patients’ service levels and reducing physicians’ working times.},

	abstract = {This article presents a probabilistic variant of the classic Lot Streaming and Scheduling Problem ({LSSP}), in which the arrival times of products are stochastic. The {LSSP} involves a multi-product lot streaming problem and a sublot scheduling problem with a flow shop model and sequence-dependent setup times. Although the deterministic {LSSP} has been studied in the literature, the problem with stochastic arrival times of products has not been explored. In this article, we first derive some properties of the {LSSP} solution and propose closed-form expressions to compute the objective function of a given solution under three commonly used stochastic distributions. Based on these expressions, we develop a new exact Dynamic Programming ({DP}) algorithm and propose an efficient {DP}-based heuristic algorithm. Additionally, we build a machine learning model to predict whether a {DP} transition needs to be considered in the heuristic to improve its efficiency. Our computational study of test instances with various arrival time distributions shows that our algorithms can achieve promising results. Furthermore, we find that the machine learning model can simultaneously reduce the computational complexity and improve the algorithm’s accuracy.},

	abstract = {Problem definition: Emergency department ({ED}) delay announcement systems are implemented in many countries. We answer three important questions pertaining to the operations and effectiveness of such systems by studying the public hospital network and {ED} waiting time ({WT}) announcement system in Hong Kong’s “universal” public healthcare system: (1) How many patients are aware of (and sensitive to) the {ED} {WT} announcements? (2) How sensitive are these patients to the announced {WT}? (3) How can the Hong Kong government improve the {WT} announcement system? Methodology/results: We study over 1.3 million patient visits to the 17 tier 1 public {EDs}. We structurally estimate the fraction of patients sensitive to the announced {WT} and their sensitivity to the announcements as well as patient characteristics that lead to higher sensitivity. In the patient’s {ED} choice decision, we estimate the trade-off between the travel distance to an {ED} and the expected {WT} at the {ED}. We find that 3.1\% of the patients are sensitive to the announced {WT}, and they are willing to travel an additional 4.8 km to save one hour of waiting. Urgent patients are less likely to be sensitive to the delay announcement than less urgent patients, but those that are sensitive are more {WT} averse than their less urgent counterparts. Counterfactual analysis shows that the average actual {WT} and number of patients who leave without being seen can be reduced by 4.6\% and 8.5\%, respectively, by increasing the fraction of sensitive patients to 15.0\% and, simultaneously, reducing the announced {WT} assessment window to one hour from the current level of three hours. Further improvement can be achieved by providing predicted {WT} information based on the current level of {ED} crowding or less extreme past performance—median {WT} rather than the currently used 95th percentile. Managerial implications: The Hong Kong government should utilize the two levers of the announcement system: the sensitive fraction of patients and information recency. Increasing the sensitive fraction can benefit the system when it is below a certain threshold level. However, administrators should exercise caution when the sensitive fraction becomes large and consider implementing additional measures to mitigate the negative effects of information delay. The sensitive group of patients can unfairly be punished for their proactiveness. Shortening the announced {WT} assessment window and providing predicted {WT} are possible alternatives that not only improve overall performance but also exhibit strong robustness to increases in the sensitive population.

	abstract = {This study considers the dynamic allocation of resources as part of urban search and rescue operations during disasters such as major flooding events. Our research aims to develop effective strategies for allocating limited resources such as helicopters to multiple geographical regions, with different population densities, distance from shelters, and "deadlines," representing a time beyond which a rescue effort would not be of much benefit. We first formulate this resource allocation problem as one of optimizing expected total cost of waiting and unmet requests in a clearing system with multiple classes of requests having class-based deadlines. A Markov decision process formulation that assumes a single-resource and two classes permits a complete characterization of the optimal policy which is described by a switching-curve with an explicit expression. Based on the structure of this optimal policy, we propose a state-dependent heuristic for the case with multiple servers and an arbitrary number of classes. We demonstrate the near-optimal performance of this heuristic by means of a numerical study. We also present results from a realistic simulation study that is based on the air rescue operations that took place in Houston, Texas, in 2017 during Hurricane Harvey. Our experimental results provide strong evidence for the superior and robust performance of the proposed state-dependent heuristic in a variety of experimental settings, and provide guidance for when to use simpler, state-independent policies.},

	abstract = {Emergency department ({ED}) crowding has become a common phenomenon worldwide. A number of interventions have been proposed to improve operations in {EDs}, such as scheduling physicians to manage varying patient demands. Motivated by a collaboration with a large {ED}, we study physician scheduling in the {ED}. The {ED} is modeled as a time-varying case managers system where the number of patients simultaneously assigned to a single physician is limited by maximum caseloads. To match real-life scenarios, we consider time-varying patient arrivals, temporary {ED} overloading, and patient-physician assignments. We first analyze patient flow and service procedures using real data to capture the features of the {ED}. Next, a mathematical model of physician scheduling is constructed. To effectively solve this complex problem, two machine learning-based solution approaches are designed. The first approach integrates an extreme gradient boosting model with Gurobi. The second involves a variable neighborhood search algorithm, in which a long short-term memory network is incorporated to evaluate the solution to the problem. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed approaches can yield high-quality solutions within reasonable time frames. The physician schedules generated by the second approach outperform those generated by the first approach and are also superior to the actual schedules used by our partner {ED}. For the data from the stable period, our solutions reduce the average patient waiting time and total physician working time by 10.32 \% and 14.79 \%, respectively, compared to the actual {ED} schedules. During the {COVID}-19 outbreak, these two metrics are respectively reduced by 8.06 \% and 12.9 \%.},

	abstract = {For a queueing system with multiple customer types differing in service-time distributions and waiting costs, it is well known that the cµ-rule is optimal if costs for waiting are incurred linearly with time. In this paper, we seek to identify policies that minimize the long-run average cost under nonlinear waiting cost functions within the set of fixed priority policies that only use the type identities of customers independently of the system state. For a single-server queueing system with Poisson arrivals and two or more customer types, we first show that some form of the cµ-rule holds with the caveat that the indices are complex, depending on the arrival rate, higher moments of service time, and proportions of customer types. Under quadratic cost functions, we provide a set of conditions that determine whether to give priority to one type over the other or not to give priority but serve them according to first-come, first-served ({FCFS}). These conditions lead to useful insights into when strict (and fixed) priority policies should be preferred over {FCFS} and when they should be avoided. For example, we find that, when traffic is heavy, service times are highly variable, and the customer types are not heterogenous, so then prioritizing one type over the other (especially a proportionally dominant type) would be worse than not assigning any priority. By means of a numerical study, we generate further insights into more specific conditions under which fixed priority policies can be considered as an alternative to {FCFS}.

	abstract = {Objectives
The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of emergency department ({ED}) crowding levels on patient admission decisions and outcomes.
Methods
A retrospective study was performed based on 2-year electronic health record data from a tertiary care hospital {ED} in Alberta, Canada. Using modified Poisson regression models, we studied the association of patient admission decisions and 7-day revisit probability with {ED} crowding levels measured by: 1) the total number of patients waiting and in treatment ({ED} census), 2) the number of boarding patients (boarder census), and 3) the average physician workload, calculated by the total number of {ED} patients divided by the number of physicians on duty (physician workload census). The control variables included age, gender, treatment area, triage level, and chief complaint. A subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the heterogeneous effects among patients of different acuity levels.
Results
Our dataset included 141,035 patient visit records after cleaning from August 2013 to July 2015. The patient admission probability was positively correlated with {ED} census (relative risk [{RR}] = 1.006, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.005 to 1.007) and physician workload census ({RR} = 1.029, 95\% {CI} = 1.027 to 1.032), but inversely correlated with boarder census ({RR} = 0.991, 95\% {CI} = 0.989 to 0.993). We further found that the 7-day revisit probability of discharged patients was positively associated with boarder census ({RR} = 1.009, 95\% {CI} = 1.004 to 1.014).
Conclusions
Patient admission probability was found to be directly associated with {ED} census and physician workload census, but inversely associated with the boarder census. The effects of boarder census and physician workload census were stronger for patients of triage levels 3–5. Our results suggested that (i) insufficient physician staffing may lead to unnecessary patient admissions; (ii) too many boarding patients in {ED} leads to an increase in unsafe discharges, and as a result, an increase in 7-day revisit probability.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to use mathematical modeling and analysis to develop insights into and policies for making bed allocation decisions in an intensive care unit ({ICU}) of a hospital during periods when patient demand is high. We first develop a stylized mathematical model in which patients’ health conditions change over time according to a Markov chain. In this model, each patient is in one of two possible health stages, one representing the critical and the other representing the highly critical health stage. The {ICU} has limited bed availability and therefore when a patient arrives and no beds are available, a decision needs to be made as to whether the patient should be admitted to the {ICU} and if so, which patient in the {ICU} should be transferred to the general ward. With the objective of minimizing the long-run average mortality rate, we provide analytical characterizations of the optimal policy under certain conditions. Then, based on these analytical results, we propose heuristic methods, which can be used under assumptions that are more general than what is assumed for the mathematical model. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed heuristic methods work well by a simulation study, which relaxes some of the restrictive assumptions of the mathematical model by considering a more complex transition structure for patient health and allowing for patients to be possibly queued for admission to the {ICU} and readmitted from the general ward after they are discharged.},
